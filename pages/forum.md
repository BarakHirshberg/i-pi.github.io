If you have questions about running i-PI, or how to perform particular kinds of simulations you may want to check out the user forum, that is organized as a <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/ipi-users" target="_blank">Google group.</a> 
If your question has not already been answered, that is the appropriate channel to get an answer in a way that also benefits future users.

If instead you believe you found a bug, or you want to contribute features, it is more appropriate to use the <a href="https://github.com/i-pi/i-pi" target="_blank">Github issue tracker</a>.
