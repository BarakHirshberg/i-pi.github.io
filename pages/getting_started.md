### How to install and run i-PI

---

If you are interested in using i-PI, we refer to the instructions contained in the
README file of the official repository, available through this [link](https://github.com/i-pi/i-pi).
Those instructions are kept up to date! Note that being written completely in Python, i-PI does
not require a real installation.
