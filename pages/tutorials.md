The i-PI distribution contains a number of examples and simple
demonstrative driver codes written in Fortran and Python 
 that can be used as the force backend for a
number of simple tests. The i-PI documentation contains a simple tutorial to get
started with using i-PI.


i-PI hands-on
-------------
You can also try an additional set of
guided examples that demonstrate some more advanced features of
i-PI. These tutorials are available here:

[i-PI guided tutorials](https://github.com/i-pi/tutorials-schools)

Note that these examples use some features (such as qTIP4P/F
water and the Zundel cation potentials in the driver code, and optionally also CP2K).
Instructions on how to install and run these codes with i-PI are contained in the tutorial.

The theory behind many types of simulation that i-PI can do and examples of simulations 
with i-PI can also be found in an online course freely available to everyone,
and accessible from this [link](https://courseware.epfl.ch/courses/course-v1:EPFL+X+2022/about).

<!--Open source codes that are interfaced with i-PI are also installed in the
VirtualBox image which includes several examples on how to use them. Some of
these codes are:

  * [CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org/)
  * [Lammps](http://lammps.sandia.gov/)
  * [QuantumEspresso](http://quantum-espresso.org)
  * [Siesta](http://departments.icmab.es/leem/siesta/)-->

Other examples
--------------

Examples on how to use the interface of i-PI with the [FHI-aims](http://www.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/aims/) code 
are included both in the i-PI distribution and in the FHI-aims distribution, with a detailed explanation in
that code's documentation.
