If 'mode' is 'abcABC', then 'cell' takes an array of 6 floats, the first three being the length of the sides of the system parallelopiped, and the last three being the angles (in degrees) between those sides. Angle A corresponds to the angle between sides b and c, and so on for B and C. If mode is 'abc', then this is the same as for 'abcABC', but the cell is assumed to be orthorhombic.
